# GMFFNet
we propose GMFFNet (Gaze Multi-scale Feature Fusion Network), a novel architecture integrating hierarchical feature interactions and adaptive attention mechanisms for robust gaze estimation.


* Download MPIIFaceGaze dataset from [here](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/research/gaze-based-human-computer-interaction/its-written-all-over-your-face-full-face-appearance-based-gaze-estimation)
* Apply data preprocessing from [here](https://phi-ai.buaa.edu.cn/Gazehub/3D-dataset/)

Store the dataset to datasets/FaceBased/MPIIFaceGaze.

We provide the code for MPIIFaceGaze dataset with leave-one-person-out evaluation.
